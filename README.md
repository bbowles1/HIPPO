# HIPPO
Human Phenotype Processing and Organization (HiPPO) is a tool that determines semantic similarity between patient phenotypes. 

Currently, HiPPO is designed to take a tab-delimited input dataset where column 1 is an identifier such as a patient ID, and column 2 contains semicolon-delimited HPO terms. It returns a matrix representing the Resnik Semantic similarity between all rows in the input dataset.
